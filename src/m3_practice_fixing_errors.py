"""
This module lets you practice correcting SYNTAX (notation) errors.

"""  # Done: 1. PUT YOUR NAME IN THE ABOVE LINE.

###############################################################################
#
# Done: 2.
#   Locate the syntax (notation) errors in this file
#   by looking for red underlines.
#
#   For each error, try to make sense of its message.
#     -- Hover and/or expand as needed -- make sure you see the message!
#
#   Then fix the errors, one by one.  IMPORTANT:
#     -- Fixing one error may bring up additional errors
#          (after a few seconds or when you run or save the module).
#     -- Each time, fix the error that is nearest the TOP of the module.
#     -- Often the SOURCE of the error may be on the line
#          just BEFORE the line with a red underline.
#     -- New errors may appear during the RUN of the module.
#
#    Finish by RUNNING the corrected program
#    and making sure that it RUNS CORRECTLY.
#      That is, make sure that (per the doc-strings) the program
#      prints two calculated values and makes a SimpleTurtle do some things.
#
#   When finished, COMMIT-and-PUSH your work, as always.
